# Run Staging Implementation - Complete

## Date: October 13, 2025

## Overview
Implemented the complete run staging system that prepares game files while maintaining challenge secrecy until the appropriate time.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Run Staging Workflow

**Stage and Save** button triggers:
1. Creates run record in database
2. Saves run plan entries
3. **Expands plan to run_results**:
   - For specific games: stores gameid and name
   - For random games: 
     - Internally selects game using seed-based selection
     - Stores actual `gameid` (needed for SFC file creation)
     - Keeps `game_name = '???'` (masked for UI)
     - Sets `revealed_early = 0`
4. **Creates SFC files**:
   - Generates unique run folder: `Run251013_0430/`
   - Patches each game using FLIPS
   - Creates numbered SFC files: `01.sfc`, `02.sfc`, etc.
   - Generates `runinfo.json` with run metadata
5. **Shows staging success modal** with:
   - Folder path display
   - "Open Folder" button
   - Conditional action buttons based on settings

### 2. Staging Progress Modal

Shows real-time progress:
- Progress bar (visual)
- Current/Total count
- Current game name being processed

### 3. Staging Success Modal

Displays after successful staging with:
- Number of games staged
- Run folder path (read-only field)
- "Open Folder" button (opens system file manager)
- **Conditional buttons** based on user settings:

#### Launch Program Option
```javascript
if (settings.launchMethod === 'program' && settings.launchProgram)
```
Shows: **ðŸš€ Launch Game** button

#### USB2SNES Auto Upload
```javascript
if (settings.launchMethod === 'usb2snes' && settings.usb2snesUploadPref !== 'manual')
```
Shows: **ðŸ“¤ Upload to USB2SNES** button

#### USB2SNES Manual Transfer
```javascript
if (settings.launchMethod === 'usb2snes' && settings.usb2snesUploadPref === 'manual')
```
Shows: 
- Instructions panel with upload directory
- **âœ“ Manually Uploaded - Launch USB2SNES** button

### 4. Game Secrecy System

**Random games are masked until reached:**

At staging time:
- `gameid`: Actual ID stored (for file creation)
- `game_name`: '???' (masked)
- `stage_description`: NULL (masked)  
- `revealed_early`: 0

During run:
- Games show as '???' until user reaches them
- When reached, revealed with `revealed_early = 0`
- If user moves forward then uses Back button, future challenges marked `revealed_early = 1`

### 5. revealed_early Flag Logic

The `revealed_early` flag tracks if a user gained an unfair advantage:

**Normal flow (revealed_early = 0):**
1. User on Challenge 1
2. Completes Challenge 1
3. Moves to Challenge 2
4. Challenge 2 revealed normally

**Early reveal (revealed_early = 1):**
1. User on Challenge 1
2. Completes Challenge 1
3. Moves to Challenge 2 (sees it)
4. Clicks **Back** button
5. Returns to Challenge 1
6. Challenge 2 now marked `revealed_early = 1` (they've seen the future)

This flag can be used in results/statistics to indicate the run had "peeking" advantage.

## Files Modified

### Frontend
- `electron/renderer/src/App.vue`:
  - Added staging progress modal
  - Added staging success modal  
  - Conditional buttons based on settings
  - Updated `undoChallenge()` to mark future challenges as revealed early
  - Updated `skipChallenge()` to reveal normally (not early)
  - Added `stageRunGames()`, `openStagingFolder()`, placeholders for launch/upload functions

### Backend  
- `electron/ipc-handlers.js`:
  - Added `db:runs:expand-and-prepare` handler (expands plan, selects random games, keeps masked)
  - Updated `db:runs:stage-games` handler (reads from run_results, creates SFC files)
  - Updated `db:runs:start` handler (no longer expands, just activates)
  - Added `db:runs:mark-revealed-early` handler (marks challenges seen via Back button)
  - Fixed `INSERT` statements to include `revealed_early` column

### IPC Layer
- `electron/preload.js`:
  - Added `expandAndStageRun()`
  - Added `markChallengeRevealedEarly()`
  - Added `ipcRenderer` access for event listeners
  - Added `shell.openPath()` for opening folders

## Database Schema

The `run_results` table stores:
- `gameid`: Actual game ID (even for masked randoms)
- `game_name`: '???' for unrevealed, actual name when revealed
- `stage_description`: NULL for unrevealed, actual description when revealed
- `was_random`: 1 if random challenge, 0 if specific
- `revealed_early`: 0 if normal reveal, 1 if seen via Back button

## Testing Notes

To test the complete flow:
1. Create a run with random games (count > 1 to test expansion)
2. Click "Stage and Save"
3. Enter run name
4. Watch staging progress modal
5. Verify staging success modal shows:
   - Correct folder path
   - Correct game count
   - Appropriate buttons for your settings
6. Click "Open Folder" to verify SFC files exist
7. Click "Start Run"
8. Verify random games show as "???"
9. Complete/skip challenges to move forward
10. Use "Back" button
11. Verify challenges you've seen are now marked `revealed_early`

## Future Work (Placeholders Created)

Functions created but not yet implemented:
- `launchGameProgram()`: Launch configured emulator/program with first SFC
- `uploadToUsb2Snes()`: Auto-upload run folder via USB2SNES websocket
- `manuallyUploadedConfirm()`: Launch USB2SNES after manual upload confirmation

These will be implemented in a future phase.

## Summary

The staging system now:
âœ… Selects all random games during staging (for SFC file creation)
âœ… Keeps random games masked in UI until reached
âœ… Creates SFC files in uniquely named run folders
âœ… Shows progress and success modals
âœ… Provides conditional action buttons based on settings
âœ… Tracks `revealed_early` for competitive integrity
âœ… Maintains game secrecy while enabling file preparation

The implementation satisfies all requirements for preparing run files while maintaining challenge secrecy and tracking any competitive advantages gained through the Back button.
