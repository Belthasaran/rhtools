Addendum to  fetchpatches.js  MODE2 features

*  --ipfsgateway=URL  option -  Option can be used multiple times when calling the script.  If the file is
not found on the first IPFS gateway, then the later gateways in the list will be searched.

* If the string %CID% is contained in the gateway URL, then it will be replaced with the CID.
If not, then the standard pattern for using the IPFS gateway will be assumed.
* If the --ipfsgateway= option is not given, then by default a list of default IPFS gateways will be used, including:
all gateway listed in the url attribute of the ipfsgateways table of the existing patchbin.db sqlite database.
Except gateways that failed within the last 10 minutes according to the notworking_timestamp attribute will
be skipped.

* During initialization, before the script starts the overall search pattern in mode2: verify the IPFS
gateway is responsive and working correctly, by requesting the
file with CID  bafybeifx7yeb55armcsxwwitkymga5xf53dxiarykms3ygqic223w5sk3m  and then wait 2 seconds

The output should consist of the text "Hello from IPFS Gateway Checker"
That output has a SHA256 sum of 7530010a7ec61daef2e028720f102a75d40af932528e742eb10cdae4de8d7004

If the IPFS gateway errors or fails to reply, then display a warning message and skip the gateway for all
subsequent searches.   Update the gateway's notworking_timestamp  timstamp in the database to match the
current time, and place the error text in the error attribute.
