# Run Execution System Implementation

**Date**: October 12, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **Complete**

---

## Overview

Implemented the complete Run Execution system with Start, Cancel, Next, and Skip buttons for managing challenge runs in the Electron app.

---

## Features Implemented

### 1. Run State Management

**New State Variables** (App.vue):
```typescript
const currentRunUuid = ref<string | null>(null);
const currentRunStatus = ref<'preparing' | 'active' | 'completed' | 'cancelled'>('preparing');
const currentRunName = ref<string>('');
const currentChallengeIndex = ref<number>(0);
const runStartTime = ref<number | null>(null);
const runElapsedSeconds = ref<number>(0);
const runTimerInterval = ref<number | null>(null);
```

**Computed Properties**:
- `isRunSaved` - True when run is saved (preparing state)
- `isRunActive` - True when run is active
- `currentChallenge` - Currently active challenge

### 2. UI Components

#### **Preparing State** (Before Run Starts)

**Modal Header**:
```
[Prepare Run: My Challenge Run]
[Set Global Conditions] [Stage and Save] [▶ Start Run] [✕]
```

- **"Set Global Conditions"** - Opens dialog for global challenge conditions
- **"Stage and Save"** - Saves run to database
- **"▶ Start Run"** - Disabled until run is saved, starts the run when clicked

**Toolbar**:
- Check All / Uncheck All
- Remove selected entries
- Move Up / Move Down
- Add Random Game controls (filters, seed, count)

**Table**:
- All controls enabled
- Entries can be edited, reordered, removed
- Drag-and-drop reordering

#### **Active State** (Run is Running)

**Modal Header**:
```
[Active Run: My Challenge Run]
[⏱ 2m 15s] [Challenge 3 / 10] [✓ Done] [⏭ Skip] [✕ Cancel Run] [✕]
```

- **Timer** - Live elapsed time display
- **Progress** - Current challenge / Total challenges
- **✓ Done** - Mark current challenge as success, move to next
- **⏭ Skip** - Skip current challenge, move to next
- **✕ Cancel Run** - Cancel entire run

**Toolbar**:
- Hidden when run is active

**Table**:
- All controls disabled
- Current challenge row highlighted in blue
- Cannot edit, reorder, or remove entries

### 3. Run Workflow

```
1. User adds games/stages to run list
   ↓
2. User clicks "Stage and Save"
   - Prompts for run name
   - Creates run in database (status = 'preparing')
   - Saves plan entries to run_plan_entries table
   - Shows "Start Run" button
   ↓
3. User clicks "▶ Start Run"
   - Confirms action
   - Changes run status to 'active'
   - Expands plan entries to run_results table
   - Starts timer
   - Highlights first challenge
   - Shows Done/Skip buttons
   ↓
4. User completes challenges
   - Clicks "✓ Done" → Records success, moves to next
   - Clicks "⏭ Skip" → Records skip, moves to next
   - Timer continues running
   - Progress updates
   ↓
5. Run completes (all challenges done)
   - Stops timer
   - Shows completion summary
   - Closes modal
   OR
   User clicks "✕ Cancel Run"
   - Confirms cancellation
   - Marks run as cancelled
   - Stops timer
   - Closes modal
```

### 4. Backend IPC Handlers

**New Channels** (ipc-handlers.js):

#### **db:runs:start**
- Updates run status to 'active'
- Sets started_at timestamp
- Expands plan_entries to run_results
- Handles count > 1 (creates multiple results)
- Masks random game/stage names as "???"
- Sets total_challenges count

#### **db:runs:record-result**
- Records challenge result (success, skipped, failed)
- Updates completed_at timestamp
- Calculates duration_seconds
- Updates run statistics (completed_challenges, skipped_challenges)

#### **db:runs:cancel**
- Updates run status to 'cancelled'
- Sets completed_at timestamp

**Exposed in preload.js**:
```javascript
startRun: (params) => ipcRenderer.invoke('db:runs:start', params)
recordChallengeResult: (params) => ipcRenderer.invoke('db:runs:record-result', params)
cancelRun: (params) => ipcRenderer.invoke('db:runs:cancel', params)
```

### 5. UI Styling

**New CSS Classes**:
```css
.btn-start-run        - Green "Start Run" button
.btn-cancel-run       - Red "Cancel Run" button
.btn-next             - Green "Done" button
.btn-skip             - Orange "Skip" button
.run-timer            - Timer display (green, bold)
.run-progress         - Progress text (gray)
.current-challenge    - Blue highlight for active challenge row
```

---

## Database Operations

### Starting a Run

**Transaction Steps**:
1. UPDATE runs SET status='active', started_at=NOW()
2. SELECT all entries from run_plan_entries
3. For each entry:
   - If count > 1, create multiple run_results
   - If random type, set gameid=NULL, game_name='???'
   - If specific type, set gameid from plan
4. UPDATE runs SET total_challenges=COUNT(run_results)

### Recording Result

**Operations**:
1. SELECT result_uuid at challengeIndex
2. UPDATE run_results SET status, completed_at, duration_seconds
3. UPDATE runs increment completed_challenges or skipped_challenges

### Cancelling Run

**Operations**:
1. UPDATE runs SET status='cancelled', completed_at=NOW()

### Database Verification

```sql
-- Check run state
SELECT run_uuid, run_name, status, started_at, completed_at, 
       total_challenges, completed_challenges, skipped_challenges
FROM runs;

-- Check plan entries
SELECT entry_uuid, sequence_number, entry_type, gameid, count, conditions
FROM run_plan_entries 
WHERE run_uuid = '<uuid>';

-- Check results
SELECT result_uuid, sequence_number, gameid, game_name, status, 
       started_at, completed_at, duration_seconds
FROM run_results
WHERE run_uuid = '<uuid>'
ORDER BY sequence_number;
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **Random Game Resolution**:
   - Implement actual random selection based on filters
   - Use seed for reproducibility
   - Reveal game name when challenge is attempted

2. **Undo Button**:
   - Allow undoing last challenge result
   - Decrement currentChallengeIndex
   - Revert database status

3. **Pause/Resume**:
   - Add pause button to stop timer
   - Track paused_duration separately
   - Resume from same challenge

4. **Run Archive**:
   - Move completed runs to run_archive table
   - Show run history
   - Display statistics

5. **Challenge Details**:
   - Show game details for current challenge
   - Display challenge conditions
   - Show stage information

6. **Run Templates**:
   - Save run configurations as templates
   - Load template when creating new run
   - Share templates with community

---

## Known Limitations

1. **No Persistence Between Sessions**:
   - Active run state lost if app closes
   - Need to implement run state recovery on startup

2. **No Undo**:
   - Cannot undo challenge completion
   - Would need to track result history

3. **Timer Only Client-Side**:
   - Timer resets if app restarts
   - Should track duration_seconds in database more granularly

4. **Random Selection Not Implemented**:
   - Random games/stages not actually selected yet
   - Names shown as "???" but not resolved
   - Need to implement selectRandomGames() function

---

## Integration Points

### With Settings System
- Launch method determines how game is launched
- Launch program path used when starting challenge
- USB2SNES integration for hardware playtesting

### With Annotation System
- Challenge completion can update game annotations
- Can ask user to rate game after completion
- Track which games were in runs

### With Stage System
- Stage challenges show stage metadata
- Stage annotations updated after completion
- Exit numbers resolved to stage descriptions
