# Database Migration Commands

## Purpose
This document lists all database migration scripts and maintenance commands that administrators should run, as required by project rules.

---

## Migration 001: New Schema Fields Support

### Date Added
January 10, 2025

### Purpose
Add support for new JSON schema format from SMWC with nested type and difficulty fields.

### Command
```bash
sqlite3 electron/rhdata.db < electron/sql/migrations/001_add_fields_type_raw_difficulty.sql
```

### What It Does
- Adds `fields_type` column (VARCHAR 255)
- Adds `raw_difficulty` column (VARCHAR 255)
- Creates indexes for query performance

### Prerequisites
- Database electron/rhdata.db must exist
- Backup recommended before running

### Expected Outcome
- Two new columns appear in gameversions table
- Two new indexes created
- No data loss
- Existing queries continue to work

### Warnings
- Safe to run multiple times (uses IF NOT EXISTS)
- No existing data is modified

---

## Migration 002: Combined Type Field

### Date Added
January 10, 2025

### Purpose
Add computed `combinedtype` column that combines all type and difficulty fields into single human-readable string.

### Command
```bash
sqlite3 electron/rhdata.db < electron/sql/migrations/002_add_combinedtype.sql
```

### What It Does
- Adds `combinedtype` column (VARCHAR 255)
- Creates index for efficient querying

### Prerequisites
- Migration 001 must be run first
- Database must be accessible

### Expected Outcome
- combinedtype column appears in gameversions table
- Index created
- Column will be NULL for existing records until backfilled

### Warnings
- Safe to run multiple times
- Existing records have NULL combinedtype until backfill runs

---

## Migration 003: Backfill Combined Type (Optional)

### Date Added
January 10, 2025

### Purpose
Populate `combinedtype` column for all existing gameversions records by parsing stored JSON data.

### Command
```bash
node electron/sql/migrations/003_backfill_combinedtype.js
```

### What It Does
- Reads all gameversions records
- Parses gvjsondata for each record
- Computes combinedtype from stored data
- Updates records with computed values
- Reports progress and completion

### Prerequisites
- Migration 002 must be run first
- Node.js installed
- better-sqlite3 package installed

### Expected Outcome
- All existing records have combinedtype populated
- ~3 seconds for 2,913 records
- 100% coverage achieved
- No data loss

### Warnings
- Uses transaction (safe)
- Can take several minutes for large databases (>10,000 records)
- Safe to re-run (idempotent)

### Output Example
```
Backfilling combinedtype for 2,913 records...
Processing records... 
âœ“ Successfully updated 2,913 records
Coverage: 100%
```

---

## Migration 004: Local Resource Tracking

### Date Added
October 12, 2025

### Purpose
Add columns to track downloaded ZIP files with HTTP headers (ETag, Last-Modified) and local filenames for efficient change detection and versioned storage.

### Command
```bash
sqlite3 electron/rhdata.db < electron/sql/migrations/004_add_local_resource_tracking.sql
```

### What It Does
- Adds `local_resource_etag` column (VARCHAR 255)
- Adds `local_resource_lastmodified` column (TIMESTAMP)
- Adds `local_resource_filename` column (VARCHAR 500)
- Creates indexes for efficient querying

### Prerequisites
- Migrations 001-003 recommended (not strictly required)
- Database must be accessible

### Expected Outcome
- Three new columns in gameversions table
- Two new indexes created
- Columns NULL for existing records (will be populated by updategames.js on next run)

### Warnings
- Safe to run multiple times (uses IF NOT EXISTS)
- These are COMPUTED COLUMNS - do not import from JSON
- Managed exclusively by updategames.js script

### Important Notes
**COMPUTED COLUMNS**: These fields are managed by the updategames.js script and must NOT be updated from external JSON data:
- `local_resource_etag` - Set from HTTP headers during download
- `local_resource_lastmodified` - Set from HTTP headers during download
- `local_resource_filename` - Computed by downloader based on version
- `combinedtype` - Computed from other type/difficulty fields
- `gvimport_time` - Auto-generated by database
- `version` - Auto-incremented by database trigger
- `gvuuid` - Auto-generated by database

Scripts importing JSON must exclude these fields.

---

## Upload Status Tracking Table (patchbin.db)

### Date Added
October 12, 2025

### Purpose
Create `upload_status` table in `patchbin.db` to track which blob files have been uploaded to various cloud storage providers (IPFS, Arweave, ArDrive, etc.).

### Command
**Note**: Table is auto-created by `list-unuploaded-blobs.js` and `mark-upload-done.js` scripts on first run.

Manual creation (optional):
```bash
sqlite3 electron/patchbin.db << 'EOF'
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS upload_status (
  file_name TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  uploaded_ipfs INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  uploaded_arweave INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  uploaded_ardrive INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  ipfs_uploaded_time TIMESTAMP NULL,
  arweave_uploaded_time TIMESTAMP NULL,
  ardrive_uploaded_time TIMESTAMP NULL,
  ipfs_cid TEXT NULL,
  arweave_txid TEXT NULL,
  ardrive_file_id TEXT NULL,
  notes TEXT NULL,
  created_time TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_time TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
EOF
```

### What It Does
- Creates table to track upload status for multiple providers
- Tracks boolean flags for upload completion (uploaded_ipfs, uploaded_arweave, uploaded_ardrive)
- Stores provider-specific identifiers (CIDs, transaction IDs, file IDs)
- Maintains timestamps of when files were uploaded
- Supports extensibility via notes field for custom providers

### Prerequisites
- Database electron/patchbin.db must exist
- No other migrations required

### Expected Outcome
- `upload_status` table created in patchbin.db
- Used by list-unuploaded-blobs.js and mark-upload-done.js scripts
- Initially empty, populated as files are marked uploaded

### Warnings
- Safe to run multiple times (uses IF NOT EXISTS)
- Table is automatically created by upload management scripts
- No manual intervention typically required

### Related Scripts
```bash
# List files not uploaded to IPFS
node list-unuploaded-blobs.js --provider=ipfs

# Mark files as uploaded
node mark-upload-done.js --provider=ipfs pblob_123.bin pblob_456.bin

# Create archive of unuploaded files
node list-unuploaded-blobs.js --provider=arweave --create-archive
```

### Verification
```bash
# Check table was created
sqlite3 electron/patchbin.db "SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name='upload_status';"

# Check schema
sqlite3 electron/patchbin.db "PRAGMA table_info(upload_status);"

# Check records
sqlite3 electron/patchbin.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM upload_status;"
```

## Phase 1 Migration: updategames.js Support Tables

### Date Added
October 12, 2025

### Purpose
Create supporting tables for updategames.js script functionality (update tracking, queue management, patch processing, metadata caching).

### Command
```bash
sqlite3 electron/rhdata.db < electron/sql/rhdata_phase1_migration.sql
```

### What It Does
Creates 5 new tables:
1. `update_status` - Track update operations
2. `game_fetch_queue` - Queue for games to process
3. `patch_files_working` - Working table for patch processing
4. `smwc_metadata_cache` - Cache SMWC API responses
5. `patchblobs_extended` - Extended patchblob metadata

### Prerequisites
- Base rhdata.sql schema must be applied first
- Database must exist

### Expected Outcome
- 5 new tables created
- Multiple indexes created
- updategames.js script becomes functional

### Warnings
- Safe to run multiple times (uses IF NOT EXISTS)
- No impact on existing tables
- Required for updategames.js to function

---

## Complete Migration Sequence

### For New Database

```bash
# 1. Create base schema
sqlite3 electron/rhdata.db < electron/sql/rhdata.sql
sqlite3 electron/patchbin.db < electron/sql/patchbin.sql

# 2. Apply all migrations in order
sqlite3 electron/rhdata.db < electron/sql/migrations/001_add_fields_type_raw_difficulty.sql
sqlite3 electron/rhdata.db < electron/sql/migrations/002_add_combinedtype.sql
sqlite3 electron/rhdata.db < electron/sql/migrations/004_add_local_resource_tracking.sql
sqlite3 electron/rhdata.db < electron/sql/rhdata_phase1_migration.sql

# 3. (Optional) Backfill combinedtype if importing existing data
node electron/sql/migrations/003_backfill_combinedtype.js
```

### For Existing Database

```bash
# Check which migrations are needed
sqlite3 electron/rhdata.db "PRAGMA table_info(gameversions);" | grep -E "fields_type|combinedtype|local_resource"

# Apply missing migrations in order
# (Run commands above for migrations that show no results)

# Apply Phase 1 migration if using updategames.js
sqlite3 electron/rhdata.db "SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name='update_status';"
# If no result, run:
sqlite3 electron/rhdata.db < electron/sql/rhdata_phase1_migration.sql
```

---

## Verification Commands

### Check Schema Version

```bash
# List all columns in gameversions table
sqlite3 electron/rhdata.db "PRAGMA table_info(gameversions);"

# Check for specific new columns
sqlite3 electron/rhdata.db "PRAGMA table_info(gameversions);" | grep -E "fields_type|raw_difficulty|combinedtype|legacy_type|local_resource"
```

### Check Migration Status

```bash
# Check if Phase 1 tables exist
sqlite3 electron/rhdata.db "SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name IN ('update_status', 'game_fetch_queue');"

# Check column counts
sqlite3 electron/rhdata.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pragma_table_info('gameversions');"
# Should be 40+ columns (was 33 originally)

# Check indexes
sqlite3 electron/rhdata.db "SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='index' AND tbl_name='gameversions';"
```

### Verify Data Integrity

```bash
# Check no data was lost
sqlite3 electron/rhdata.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM gameversions;"
# Should match pre-migration count

# Check new columns exist and have proper types
sqlite3 electron/rhdata.db "
  SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total,
    COUNT(combinedtype) as with_combinedtype,
    COUNT(fields_type) as with_fields_type,
    COUNT(local_resource_filename) as with_local_filename
  FROM gameversions;
"
```

## Rollback Procedures

### For Migration 001-004

**No automated rollback** - These migrations add columns only.

Manual rollback (if necessary):
```sql
-- Remove columns (SQLite requires table recreation)
-- CAUTION: Backup first!

BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Create temp table without new columns
CREATE TABLE gameversions_backup AS 
SELECT 
  gvuuid, section, gameid, version, removed, obsoleted,
  gametype, name, time, added, moderated, author, authors,
  submitter, demo, featured, length, difficulty, url,
  download_url, name_href, author_href, obsoleted_by,
  patchblob1_name, pat_sha224, size, description,
  gvjsondata, gvchange_attributes, gvchanges, tags, tags_href,
  gvimport_time, siglistuuid
FROM gameversions;

-- Drop original
DROP TABLE gameversions;

-- Rename backup
ALTER TABLE gameversions_backup RENAME TO gameversions;

-- Recreate trigger and indexes
-- (see original rhdata.sql)

COMMIT;
```

**Recommendation**: Keep backups instead of rolling back.

### For Phase 1 Migration

```bash
# Drop Phase 1 tables
sqlite3 electron/rhdata.db << 'EOF'
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS update_status;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS patch_files_working;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS game_fetch_queue;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS smwc_metadata_cache;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS patchblobs_extended;
EOF
```

---

## Backup Procedures

### Before Any Migration

```bash
# Timestamp backup
cp electron/rhdata.db electron/rhdata.db.backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)

# Verify backup
ls -lh electron/rhdata.db.backup-*
```

### Restore from Backup

```bash
# List backups
ls -lh electron/rhdata.db.backup-*

# Restore specific backup
cp electron/rhdata.db.backup-20251012-103000 electron/rhdata.db
```

---

## Maintenance Commands

### Clear Expired Cache (updategames.js)

```sql
-- Remove expired metadata cache entries
DELETE FROM smwc_metadata_cache 
WHERE cache_expires < datetime('now');

-- Vacuum to reclaim space
VACUUM;
```

### Clean Old Update Status Records

```sql
-- Keep only recent update status (last 30 days)
DELETE FROM update_status 
WHERE started_at < datetime('now', '-30 days');
```

### Archive Completed Queue Items

```sql
-- Optional: Clean up old completed queue items
DELETE FROM game_fetch_queue 
WHERE status = 'completed' 
  AND completed_at < datetime('now', '-90 days');

-- Also clean related patch files working records
DELETE FROM patch_files_working 
WHERE queueuuid NOT IN (SELECT queueuuid FROM game_fetch_queue);
```

---

## Database Statistics

### Check Database Size

```bash
ls -lh electron/rhdata.db
sqlite3 electron/rhdata.db "SELECT page_count * page_size as size FROM pragma_page_count(), pragma_page_size();"
```

### Table Statistics

```bash
sqlite3 electron/rhdata.db << 'EOF'
SELECT 
  'gameversions' as table_name, 
  COUNT(*) as records 
FROM gameversions

UNION ALL

SELECT 'patchblobs', COUNT(*) FROM patchblobs

UNION ALL

SELECT 'update_status', COUNT(*) FROM update_status

UNION ALL

SELECT 'game_fetch_queue', COUNT(*) FROM game_fetch_queue;
EOF
```

---

## Support

### If Migration Fails

1. **Check error message** carefully
2. **Verify prerequisites** (previous migrations, backups)
3. **Check database accessibility** (not open in other programs)
4. **Restore from backup** if necessary
5. **Review migration SQL** for syntax errors

### If Data Seems Wrong After Migration

1. **Check record counts** - Should match pre-migration
2. **Verify NULL handling** - New columns should be NULL for old records
3. **Run verification queries** (see above)
4. **Check documentation** for expected behavior

---

## Migration 001: User Annotations (clientdata.db)

### Date Added
October 12, 2025

### Purpose
Add tables to `clientdata.db` for storing user-specific game annotations (ratings, status, notes) and stage-level annotations.

### Command
```bash
sqlite3 electron/clientdata.db < electron/sql/migrations/001_clientdata_user_annotations.sql
```

### What It Does
Creates 3 new tables:
1. `user_game_annotations` - User-specific game data (status, rating, hidden flag, notes)
2. `game_stages` - Stage/exit metadata for games that have documented stages
3. `user_stage_annotations` - User-specific stage ratings and notes

Also creates:
- 2 convenience views for querying annotated data
- 3 triggers for auto-updating timestamps
- 7 indexes for query performance

### Prerequisites
- Database electron/clientdata.db must exist
- If migrating existing installation, backup recommended

### Expected Outcome
- Three new tables in clientdata.db
- Each user can now store:
  - Game status (Default/In Progress/Finished)
  - Personal difficulty ratings (1-5 scale)
  - Hidden flag for hiding games
  - Personal notes
  - Stage-specific ratings and notes

### Table Details

**user_game_annotations**:
- `gameid` - References game from rhdata.db (PRIMARY KEY)
- `status` - Default/In Progress/Finished
- `user_rating` - INTEGER 1-5 or NULL
- `hidden` - 0 or 1 (boolean)
- `user_notes` - TEXT
- `created_at`, `updated_at` - TIMESTAMP

**game_stages**:
- `stage_key` - Format: "gameid-exitnumber" (PRIMARY KEY)
- `gameid`, `exit_number` - Stage identification
- `description` - Stage description
- `public_rating` - Community rating (DECIMAL)
- `created_at`, `updated_at` - TIMESTAMP

**user_stage_annotations**:
- `stage_key` - Format: "gameid-exitnumber" (PRIMARY KEY)
- `gameid`, `exit_number` - References stage
- `user_rating` - INTEGER 1-5 or NULL
- `user_notes` - TEXT
- `created_at`, `updated_at` - TIMESTAMP

### Warnings
- Safe to run multiple times (uses IF NOT EXISTS)
- Each user installation should have their own clientdata.db
- This database should NOT be shared between users

### Environment Variable
Scripts can use `CLIENTDATA_DB_PATH` environment variable to override database path:
```bash
export CLIENTDATA_DB_PATH=/path/to/my/clientdata.db
```

### Verification
```bash
# Check tables were created
sqlite3 electron/clientdata.db "SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name LIKE 'user_%' OR name='game_stages';"

# Expected output:
# user_game_annotations
# game_stages
# user_stage_annotations

# Check views were created
sqlite3 electron/clientdata.db "SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='view';"

# Expected output:
# v_games_with_annotations
# v_stages_with_annotations
```

### Usage Examples

```sql
-- Set a game as "In Progress" with rating 4
INSERT OR REPLACE INTO user_game_annotations (gameid, status, user_rating, hidden, user_notes)
VALUES ('12345', 'In Progress', 4, 0, 'Really enjoying this one!');

-- Hide a game
UPDATE user_game_annotations SET hidden = 1 WHERE gameid = '12345';

-- Add stage information for a game
INSERT INTO game_stages (stage_key, gameid, exit_number, description, public_rating)
VALUES ('12345-01', '12345', '01', 'First Level', 3.5);

-- Rate a specific stage
INSERT OR REPLACE INTO user_stage_annotations (stage_key, gameid, exit_number, user_rating, user_notes)
VALUES ('12345-01', '12345', '01', 5, 'Fantastic level design!');

-- Query all user annotations for games
SELECT * FROM v_games_with_annotations WHERE status = 'In Progress';

-- Query stages with user ratings
SELECT * FROM v_stages_with_annotations WHERE user_rating >= 4;
```

## Migration 002: Enhanced Ratings and Run System (clientdata.db)

### Date Added
October 12, 2025

### Purpose
Add dual rating system (difficulty + review), version-specific annotations, random exclusion controls, and complete run system for planning/executing challenge runs.

### Command
```bash
sqlite3 electron/clientdata.db < electron/sql/migrations/002_clientdata_enhanced_ratings_and_runs.sql
```

### What It Does
Creates/enhances 9 components:

**Enhanced Tables**:
1. `user_game_annotations` - Adds user_difficulty_rating, user_review_rating, exclude_from_random
2. `user_stage_annotations` - Adds user_difficulty_rating, user_review_rating

**New Tables**:
3. `user_game_version_annotations` - Version-specific ratings/status/notes
4. `runs` - Run metadata and status tracking
5. `run_plan_entries` - Planned challenges in a run
6. `run_results` - Actual execution results
7. `run_archive` - Archived run metadata

**New Views**:
8. `v_active_run` - Current active run summary
9. `v_run_progress` - Current run progress details

Also updates existing views to include new rating fields.

### Key Features

**Dual Ratings**:
- `user_difficulty_rating` (1-5): How hard is it?
- `user_review_rating` (1-5): How much do you recommend it?

**Version-Specific Annotations**:
- Rate different versions of same game differently
- Override game-wide ratings for specific versions
- Example: v1 might be harder (difficulty=5) than v2 (difficulty=3)

**Random Exclusion**:
- User-level: `exclude_from_random` flag
- Curator-level: See Migration 005

**Run System**:
- Plan runs with specific games or random challenges
- Execute runs with timing and result tracking
- Support for 4 entry types: game, stage, random_game, random_stage
- Track success/skip/fail for each challenge
- Archive completed runs for history

### Prerequisites
- Migration 001 (user annotations) must be run first
- Database must be accessible

### Expected Outcome
- 4 new tables in clientdata.db
- 3 enhanced tables with new columns
- 2 new views for run tracking
- Dual rating system functional
- Version-specific annotations supported
- Run system ready for use

### Warnings
- Safe to run multiple times (uses IF NOT EXISTS and ALTER TABLE)
- Keeps `user_rating` column for backwards compatibility
- Applications should migrate to user_difficulty_rating
- Run system is complex - see docs/ENHANCED_RATINGS_AND_RUN_SYSTEM.md

### Verification
```bash
# Check new tables
sqlite3 electron/clientdata.db "SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name LIKE '%run%';"

# Expected output:
# runs
# run_plan_entries
# run_results
# run_archive

# Check new columns
sqlite3 electron/clientdata.db "PRAGMA table_info(user_game_annotations);" | grep -E "difficulty|review|exclude"

# Check new views
sqlite3 electron/clientdata.db "SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='view' AND name LIKE '%run%';"

# Expected output:
# v_active_run
# v_run_progress
```

### Usage Examples

```sql
-- Set both ratings for a game
INSERT OR REPLACE INTO user_game_annotations 
  (gameid, user_difficulty_rating, user_review_rating, status)
VALUES ('12345', 4, 5, 'In Progress');
-- Difficulty 4 (Hard), Review 5 (Highly Recommended)

-- Set version-specific rating
INSERT OR REPLACE INTO user_game_version_annotations 
  (annotation_key, gameid, version, user_difficulty_rating, user_review_rating)
VALUES ('12345-2', '12345', 2, 3, 5);
-- Version 2 is easier (3) but still great (5)

-- Exclude from random
UPDATE user_game_annotations SET exclude_from_random = 1 WHERE gameid = '12345';

-- Create a run
INSERT INTO runs (run_uuid, run_name, status)
VALUES (lower(hex(randomblob(16))), 'Morning Run', 'preparing');

-- Add specific game to run
INSERT INTO run_plan_entries 
  (run_uuid, sequence_number, entry_type, gameid, count)
VALUES ('abc123', 1, 'game', '12345', 1);

-- Add random kaizo challenges
INSERT INTO run_plan_entries 
  (run_uuid, sequence_number, entry_type, count, filter_type, filter_seed)
VALUES ('abc123', 2, 'random_game', 5, 'Kaizo', 'seed789');
```

## Migration 005: Local Run Exclusion (rhdata.db)

### Date Added
October 12, 2025

### Purpose
Add curator-controlled flag to exclude games from random selection in gameversions table.

### Command
```bash
sqlite3 electron/rhdata.db < electron/sql/migrations/005_add_local_runexcluded.sql
```

### What It Does
- Adds `local_runexcluded` column (INTEGER DEFAULT 0) to gameversions table
- Creates index on local_runexcluded for efficient filtering
- Marks field as COMPUTED COLUMN (do not import from JSON)

### Rationale
Curators need ability to exclude certain games from random selection independent of user preferences:
- Broken or buggy games
- Inappropriate content
- Test/demo games
- Duplicate entries
- Games with missing files

### Prerequisites
- Database must be accessible
- Backup recommended

### Expected Outcome
- gameversions table has new local_runexcluded column
- Index created for efficient queries
- All existing games default to 0 (not excluded)

### Warnings
- Safe to run multiple times (uses IF NOT EXISTS)
- This is a **COMPUTED COLUMN** - scripts must NOT import from JSON
- This field complements user-level exclude_from_random in clientdata.db

### COMPUTED COLUMNS
Fields that must NOT be imported from JSON:
- local_runexcluded (NEW)
- combinedtype
- gvimport_time
- version
- gvuuid
- local_resource_etag
- local_resource_lastmodified
- local_resource_filename

### Verification
```bash
# Check column exists
sqlite3 electron/rhdata.db "PRAGMA table_info(gameversions);" | grep runexcluded

# Expected output:
# 41|local_runexcluded|INTEGER|0|0|0

# Check index exists
sqlite3 electron/rhdata.db "SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='index' AND name='idx_gameversions_runexcluded';"

# Count excluded games
sqlite3 electron/rhdata.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM gameversions WHERE local_runexcluded = 1;"
```

### Usage Examples

```sql
-- Exclude a game from random selection
UPDATE gameversions SET local_runexcluded = 1 WHERE gameid = '12345';

-- Un-exclude a game
UPDATE gameversions SET local_runexcluded = 0 WHERE gameid = '12345';

-- Get eligible games for random selection (combining both exclusion flags)
ATTACH DATABASE 'electron/clientdata.db' AS clientdata;

SELECT gv.gameid, gv.name, gv.difficulty
FROM gameversions gv
LEFT JOIN clientdata.user_game_annotations uga ON gv.gameid = uga.gameid
WHERE gv.removed = 0
  AND gv.obsoleted = 0
  AND gv.local_runexcluded = 0  -- Curator says OK
  AND (uga.exclude_from_random IS NULL OR uga.exclude_from_random = 0)  -- User says OK
  AND gv.version = (SELECT MAX(version) FROM gameversions WHERE gameid = gv.gameid)
ORDER BY RANDOM()
LIMIT 10;

DETACH DATABASE clientdata;
```
