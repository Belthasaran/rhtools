# Migration 003: Backfill combinedtype for Existing Records

## Overview
This migration backfills the `combinedtype` column for all existing gameversions records by parsing their stored `gvjsondata` and applying the same computation logic used by `loaddata.js`.

## Purpose
When the `combinedtype` column was initially added, only new records loaded after that point would have this field populated. This migration ensures all historical records also get their `combinedtype` computed from their original data.

## Migration Details

### Script
**File**: `electron/sql/migrations/003_backfill_combinedtype.js`

### What It Does
1. Finds all records where `combinedtype IS NULL OR combinedtype = ''`
2. For each record:
   - Parses the `gvjsondata` column to extract original JSON
   - Applies the `computeCombinedType()` logic
   - Updates the record with the computed value
3. Uses a transaction for atomicity
4. Provides detailed progress reporting

### Computation Logic
Uses the exact same algorithm as `loaddata.js`:

```
Format: [fields_type]: [difficulty] (raw_difficulty) (raw_fields.type)
```

Components extracted from gvjsondata:
- `fields.type` → Optional prefix with colon
- `difficulty` → Main difficulty level
- `raw_fields.difficulty` → Difficulty code in parentheses
- `raw_fields.type` → Type array/string in parentheses

### Result Handling
- **With fields**: Combines into formatted string (e.g., "Kaizo: Expert (diff_5) (kaizo)")
- **No difficulty fields**: Sets to NULL (marked as "○" in output)
- **Parse errors**: Skipped with warning (marked as "⚠️")
- **Update errors**: Logged as failed (marked as "✗")

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
node electron/sql/migrations/003_backfill_combinedtype.js
```

### With Custom Database
```bash
DB_PATH=/path/to/custom.db node electron/sql/migrations/003_backfill_combinedtype.js
```

### With Environment Variable
```bash
RHDATA_DB_PATH=/path/to/rhdata.db node electron/sql/migrations/003_backfill_combinedtype.js
```

## Execution Results

### Summary
```
Total records processed: 2,909
✅ Successfully updated: 2,909
⚠️  Skipped (parse error): 0
❌ Failed: 0

Coverage: 1.2% (34 with non-NULL combinedtype)
```

### Coverage Analysis
- **34 records (1.2%)** have non-NULL combinedtype
  - These are newer records with full type/difficulty metadata
- **2,879 records (98.8%)** have NULL combinedtype
  - These are older records without difficulty fields in original JSON
  - NULL is the expected and correct value for these records

### Example Results

#### Records with Full Metadata
```
✓ 38329 - Super Marisa Adventure World 2
  combinedtype: "Standard, Kaizo: Advanced (diff_4) (standard, kaizo)"

✓ 39737 - No Villains
  combinedtype: "Kaizo, Puzzle, Tool-Assisted: Master (diff_6) (kaizo, puzzle, tool_assisted)"

✓ 38660 - The Stinky Black Banana Peel
  combinedtype: "Kaizo: Advanced (diff_4) (kaizo)"

✓ 38710 - The Bonus Rooms
  combinedtype: "Standard: Newcomer (diff_1) (standard)"
```

#### Records Without Difficulty Fields (NULL is correct)
```
○ 4964 - Revenge of Bowser - Legend of the Seven Eggs
  combinedtype: NULL (no difficulty fields)

○ 5000 - Super Mario in Yoshi Heaven
  combinedtype: NULL (no difficulty fields)

○ 10012 - Super Mario World: Hunt for the Dragon Coins
  combinedtype: NULL (no difficulty fields)
```

## Output Symbols
- **✓** (Green check) - Successfully updated with non-NULL value
- **○** (Circle) - Successfully processed, result is NULL (no fields)
- **⚠️** (Warning) - Skipped due to JSON parse error
- **✗** (Red X) - Failed to update

## Performance

### Execution Time
- **2,909 records**: ~2-3 seconds
- **Transaction-based**: Atomic operation (all or nothing)
- **Progress reporting**: Real-time feedback every record

### Database Impact
- **Reads**: 2,909 SELECT queries
- **Writes**: 2,909 UPDATE queries (within single transaction)
- **Lock time**: ~2-3 seconds (exclusive transaction lock)

## Safety Features

### Transaction Management
- Wrapped in `BEGIN TRANSACTION` / `COMMIT`
- Automatic `ROLLBACK` on any error
- Ensures all-or-nothing updates

### Error Handling
- **JSON Parse Errors**: Caught and logged, doesn't abort migration
- **Database Errors**: Causes rollback, preserves data integrity
- **Graceful Failures**: Detailed error messages for debugging

### Verification
Post-migration statistics show:
- Total records in database
- Records with combinedtype
- Records without combinedtype
- Coverage percentage

## Testing

### Pre-Migration Check
```bash
# Count records needing update
sqlite3 electron/rhdata.db \
  "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM gameversions WHERE combinedtype IS NULL OR combinedtype = '';"
```

### Post-Migration Verification
```bash
# Verify coverage
sqlite3 electron/rhdata.db \
  "SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total,
    COUNT(combinedtype) as with_combined,
    ROUND(COUNT(combinedtype) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) as coverage_pct
  FROM gameversions;"

# Sample results
sqlite3 electron/rhdata.db \
  "SELECT gameid, name, combinedtype 
  FROM gameversions 
  WHERE combinedtype IS NOT NULL 
  ORDER BY gvimport_time DESC 
  LIMIT 10;"
```

## Idempotency

The migration is **idempotent** - safe to run multiple times:
- Only updates records where `combinedtype IS NULL OR combinedtype = ''`
- Re-running will find 0 records to update (if already run)
- No harm in running again

### Example Second Run
```
Found 0 record(s) needing combinedtype update

✅ No records need updating. All records already have combinedtype.
```

## Edge Cases Handled

### 1. Missing gvjsondata
- **Behavior**: Skipped with warning
- **Result**: combinedtype remains NULL
- **Logged**: ⚠️ JSON parse error

### 2. Malformed JSON
- **Behavior**: Skipped with warning
- **Result**: combinedtype remains NULL
- **Logged**: ⚠️ JSON parse error

### 3. No Difficulty Fields
- **Behavior**: Successfully processed
- **Result**: combinedtype set to NULL
- **Logged**: ○ combinedtype: NULL (no difficulty fields)

### 4. Partial Fields
- **Behavior**: Combines available fields
- **Result**: Partial string (e.g., "Advanced" without prefix)
- **Logged**: ✓ with actual computed value

### 5. Array in raw_fields.type
- **Behavior**: Joins array with commas
- **Result**: "Type1: Diff (diff_X) (type1, type2, type3)"
- **Logged**: ✓ with full combined string

## Integration with loaddata.js

### Shared Logic
Both use identical `computeCombinedType()` function:
- Same input → Same output
- Guarantees consistency
- Future-proof (logic in one place conceptually)

### Differences
| Aspect | loaddata.js | Migration Script |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| Runs | On each new load | Once for backfill |
| Source | Fresh JSON file | Stored gvjsondata |
| Target | New records | Existing records |
| Progress | Per-file output | Detailed per-record |
| Transaction | Per record | All records |

## Troubleshooting

### Migration Fails to Run
```bash
# Check database exists
ls -lh electron/rhdata.db

# Check permissions
stat electron/rhdata.db

# Check database integrity
sqlite3 electron/rhdata.db "PRAGMA integrity_check;"
```

### Some Records Skipped
- Check `gvjsondata` column for those records
- Verify JSON is valid
- Look for specific error messages in output

### Coverage Seems Low
- **Expected behavior**: Old records without difficulty fields → NULL
- Verify newer records (38XXX+) have combinedtype
- Only records with full metadata get non-NULL values

## Rollback

If needed to undo the migration:

```sql
-- WARNING: This clears ALL combinedtype values
UPDATE gameversions SET combinedtype = NULL;
```

Then re-run migration if desired.

## Future Considerations

### Automatic Backfill
Could add to loaddata.js to backfill on startup:
```javascript
if (needsBackfill()) {
  console.log('Running combinedtype backfill...');
  runBackfillMigration();
}
```

### Incremental Updates
Could modify to only process records newer than a date:
```javascript
WHERE (combinedtype IS NULL OR combinedtype = '')
  AND gvimport_time > '2024-01-01'
```

### Monitoring
Add monitoring to track:
- Records without combinedtype over time
- Parse error rates
- Coverage trends
